# Paulo H. Sousa

**Passionate Front-End Developer | Problem Solver | UX Enthusiast**

## Greetings! 👋

As a dynamic Front-End Developer with a thirst for knowledge and a commitment to continuous improvement, I am on a mission to leverage my skills in problem-solving and rapid reasoning to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.

## 🌱 Learning Journey:

Embarking on my front-end development journey as a self-starter, I quickly realized my passion for swift problem resolution. My trajectory took a significant leap when I embraced an enriching opportunity at a software factory. Learning from seasoned professionals, I developed a fresh perspective, fostering a belief that collective empowerment can create a better world. I am driven by the philosophy that everyone has the potential to elevate their skills, fostering a community dedicated to mutual learning and a sustainable future.

## 🔧 Current Role:

At present, I am focused on developing techniques for problem-solving through the creation of web, mobile, and PWA applications. My technical toolkit includes:

- JavaScript and TypeScript     
- Front-end and Back-end Development
- REST API Integration and Node.js
- Dynamic and Cross-Platform Websites
- Attractive Design Development
- Database Management, Login, and Password Handling
- Git, GitHub, and Amazon AWS

## 🚀 Specialization:

Eager to enhance user experiences, I am currently immersed in the realm of User Experience (UX) design. I see it as a pivotal element in crafting solutions that not only address problems but elevate overall user satisfaction.

## 📚 Beyond Code:

An avid reader, I attribute my diverse worldview and analytical thinking skills to literature. This has greatly influenced how I approach problem-solving and expand my cognitive abilities.
